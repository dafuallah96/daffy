I've often wondered when the right time would be to leave my mark on the internet, and today feels like that day. I’m excited to share the knowledge I've gained, insights I've developed, and my personal experiences.

Well, this is my little garden. You can address me as Daffy.

I am currently working at MoneyLion as an Engineer, where I handle various responsibilities, including being an Analyst Engineer, a Data Engineer, and providing support for the organization’s needs.

Previously, I worked as a freelancer, helping clients meet their business needs.

I have a cat named Latte, she even looks like one.
